# Learnings of a software engineer
Things I learnt on the way to become a senior software engineer.

## Code
* Refactoring without tests is too risky.
* Document decisions and special notes. Make it easy to find. Crucial.

## Teams
* Do the homework before meeting people. Better use of everyone's time.
