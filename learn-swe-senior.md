# Learnings of a software engineer
Things I learnt on the way to become a senior software engineer.

## Code
* Refactoring without tests is too risky.
* Document decisions and special notes. Make it easy to find.
* Scrum carries the risk of only delivering MVP1, and not reaching MVP2.
* Performance improvements can be done well by understanding the domain and measuring.
* If your standards do not align with the standards of everyone else, you might be having a difficult time. Life is easier if you lower / up your standards.

## Teams
* Do the homework before meeting people. Better use of everyone's time.
* Before asking questions on a meeting, think if most of the audience would understand the premise.  
If the answer is "No", it might be better to meet the relevant people outside the meeting later on.
* To convince non-tech clients to care about tech debt, present the benefits in terms of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators e.g., lesser risk, save money).
