# Learnings of a software engineer
Things I learnt on the way to become a senior software engineer.

## Code
* Refactoring without tests is too risky.
* Document decisions and special notes. Make it easy to find.
* Performance improvements can be done well by understanding the domain and measuring.
* When refactoring, just do refactoring. Without coupling it with feature changes. The problem of coupling is large commits where it's not clear what is the intended change.
* Defining interfaces between systems is important for data transfer, sending updates.
* Why are dedicated DB / Ops teams helpful? App Devs can also do / have done similar work, but they don't get to spend a majority of their time looking into infra. Of course, this brings up the challenge of working in silos. A better approach may be for devs to investigate issues, and reach out to specialized teams when problems become difficult.
* When reviewing code of a new joiner, it's easier and more helpful to work on improving the quality of code by one / two levels, not to take it from level 1  to level 10 in one Pull Request.
* It's worthwhile to set up automated tools for formatting, linting, test coverage tracking. It really saves time in the long run.
* Expertise is helpful. You can present ideas which aren't obvious and also help other get unstuck.
* It's possible to review code of a feature you are new to, it can help you learn more about it, and do reviews better.

## Work
* There's generally multiple things to work on. Ask yourself what is the criticality, and effort of each task that you are doing?
* Don't have too many goals, three-four a year are good enough. But fully focus on them.
* Adaptation to new environments and tech-stacks are a great way to stay relevant. It's good to say "IDK" when you really don't know.
* Estimation is a core skill. New joiners tend to underestimate, if they have been writing unmaintainable code as part of their learning process.
* Do homework before asking questions, but do ask, and learn how much homework is necessary for you before asking.

## Teams
* Do the homework before meeting people. Better use of everyone's time.
* Before asking questions on a meeting, think if most of the audience would understand the premise.  
If the answer is "No", it might be better to meet the relevant people outside the meeting later on.
* To convince non-tech clients to care about tech debt, present the benefits in terms of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators e.g., lesser risk, save money).
* Having a common goal and standard can make collaboration easier.
* Talk about processes, ideas, not about other people. It's too easy to do that, and isn't helpful.
* When introducing new processes in a team, get feedback periodically.

## Projects
* Scrum carries the risk of only delivering MVP1, and not reaching MVP2.
* Showing progressive updates of a product to one person isn't good enough. It's important to get it reviewed by someone outside the system, or actual users if possible.
* Don't ask solutions from users or product managers, ask them what they want, why they want it, and present them with multiple solutions to choose from.
* Providing customer support is the best way for a single person to learn about the actual problems users are facing.
* Maintain a defect board, and groom it occasionally. Else the same things come up again and again.

## Interview
* Go with the mindset that you want this person to be part of your team.
* Technical skills are one thing, another important one is how much do you like working with this person.
* "They can be trained on X tech". doesn't happen often, but it does happen some times. Generally, they will not have the time to spend there. There are more important things.
